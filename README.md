# VRP-Lab
VRP-Lab is a research-oriented framework for studying Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) from both a classical optimization and a learning-based perspective. The initial focus is on the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW, Solomon instances).
